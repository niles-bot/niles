admin:
  noarg: |-
    You can restrict who can control Niles and the associated Google Calendar with roles.
    Niles will only allow one role to be used, and it must have a unique name.
    The person assigning the restriction must have the role being assigned.
    You can allow everyone to use Niles again by entering `!admin everyone`
    i.e. Create a role called *Scheduler*, and then tell Niles to only allow people with that role using `!admin Scheduler` (case sensitive)
  prompt: Do you want to restrict the use of the calendar to people with the `{[adminRole}}`? **(y/n)**
  no_role: You do not have the role you're trying to assign. Remember that adding Roles is case-sensitive
  prompt_everyone: Do you want to allow everyone in this channel/server to use Niles? **(y/n)**

setup:
  error: You haven't finished setting up! Try `!setup` for details on how to start.

    Hi! Lets get me setup for use in this Discord. The steps are outlined below, but for a detailed setup guide, visit https://nilesbot.com/start
    1. Invite `niles-291@niles-169605.iam.gserviceaccount.com` to 'Make changes to events' under the Permission Settings on the Google Calendar you want to use with Niles
    2. Enter the Calendar ID of the calendar to Discord using the `!id` command, i.e. `!id 123abc@123abc.com`
    3. Enter the timezone you want to use in Discord with the `!tz` command, i.e. i.e. `!tz America/New_York` or `!tz UTC+4` or `!tz EST` No spaces in formatting.
    
    Niles should now be able to sync with your Google calendar and interact with on you on Discord, try `!display` to get started!";

no_cal: |-
  I can't seem to find your calendar! This is usually because you haven't invited Niles to access your calendar, run `!setup` to make sure you followed Step 1.
  You should also check that you have entered the correct calendar id using `!id`.
